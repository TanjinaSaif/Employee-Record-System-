# Employee-Record-System-
A basic Employee Record System using Java and JavaFX.
This was a final java project for the semester 2.1.
The main language used here is java. The user interface is made using JavaFX properties.
I have used Sceenbuilder software combined with netbeans IDE to make the individual pages of the UI.
There's no database used here instead I used arrayList.
The features are Add Employee,Search Employee, View salary,Increase salary,view Employees etc.
